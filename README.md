# Email Summarization

## Overview

This project aims to address the challenge of managing extensive email communication within the software production lifecycle by integrating advanced email summarization capabilities. By employing Python, Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible, we establish a robust ML-Ops pipeline that automates build, deployment, and infrastructure management processes. This integration streamlines communication and optimizes software development workflows, reducing the overhead associated with manual email review. Docker ensures consistency and portability across environments, while Ansible automates infrastructure tasks, promoting improved quality and maintainability. Ultimately, our solution enhances software engineering practices, facilitating better knowledge retention and decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Our project addresses the challenge of effectively managing extensive email communication within the software production lifecycle by integrating advanced email summarization capabilities. By employing Python, Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible, we establish a robust ML-Ops pipeline that automates build, deployment, and infrastructure management processes. This integration not only streamlines communication but also optimizes software development workflows, reducing the overhead associated with manual email review. Docker ensures consistency and portability across environments, while Ansible automates infrastructure tasks, promoting improved quality and maintainability. Ultimately, our solution enhances software engineering practices, facilitating better knowledge retention and decision-making.

## Technologies and Tools

### Required Imports

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: An extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit, and ORM library.
- **mysql-connector-python**: A MySQL database connector for Python.
- **Transformers**: A library developed by Hugging Face for natural language processing (NLP).
- **python-dotenv**: A library for managing environment variables.
- **torch (PyTorch)**: An open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD are software development practices designed to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. The primary goal is to streamline the development process and minimize errors by continuously integrating new code and running automated tests to ensure stability and functionality.

### Git Version Control

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for software development and version control tasks. It is designed to handle projects of all sizes with speed and efficiency.

### Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It automates the building, testing, and deployment of code changes.

### Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated containers. These containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, simplifying the development, testing, and deployment of applications across various environments.

### Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for automating various IT tasks. It uses a YAML-based syntax to describe the desired state of a system or environment and then executes tasks to ensure that the system meets that state.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Installation and Setup

### Jenkins Installation Steps

1. Install Java:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install default-jdk
   ```

2. Add the Jenkins Repository Key:
   ```bash
   wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

3. Add the Jenkins repository to your system:
   ```bash
   sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
   ```

4. Install Jenkins:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install jenkins
   ```

5. Start the Jenkins service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

### Docker Setup

- Dockerfile example:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.8
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY requirements.txt ./
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
  COPY . .
  COPY wait-for-db.sh /app/
  RUN chmod +x wait-for-db.sh
  CMD ["./wait-for-db.sh", "db", "3306", "python", "run.py"]
  ```

### Ansible Setup

1. Update the package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install the Ansible package:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```

### Ansible Playbook

- Example playbook file:
  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy Kubernetes cluster
    hosts: localhost
    become: false
    tasks:
      - name: Apply Kubernetes resources
        command: kubectl apply -f ../k8s/
  ```

- Example inventory file:
  ```ini
  localhost ansible_user=keshav ansible_ssh_pass=8989 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
  ```
